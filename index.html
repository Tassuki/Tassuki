				<h2>Our Story</h2>

				<h3>Welcome to Tassuki!</h3>
				<p>
					At Tassuki, we believe that creativity has no limits. Our journey began with a passion for experimenting with batik fabrics, and through this exploration, we discovered that there’s so much more to batik than simply discarding leftover materials. Instead of letting those beautiful scraps go to waste, we envisioned a way to transform them into something new.
				</p>
				<p>
					That’s how our line of handcrafted bags was born. We combined wooden handles with canvas and applied the Tsukiji coloring technique, creating unique pieces that celebrate both tradition and innovation. Each bag tells its own story, and we’re excited to share it with you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Join us as we continue to explore, experiment, and reimagine what’s possible with batik. Let’s create something extraordinary together.

					<h2>Our Wonder</h2>
					<p>
						The thrill of working with different fabrics and techniques led us to rethink how batik could be used. What started as an experiment quickly evolved into a collection of wooden-handle bags, canvas accessories, and much more. By blending heritage with modern craftsmanship, we’ve created products that are as practical as they are artistic.
